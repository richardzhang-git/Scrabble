    A simple bot that:
    1. Finds anchor points (squares next to existing tiles)
    2. Tries to form valid words using tiles from rack
    3. Returns a valid move found

    This is basically brute forcing what words are possible given the setup.
    HOWEVER, this bot is not good. It does not check for legal crosswords (words formed perpendicular to the new word),
    nor is it that fast/smart.
    It also doesn't address the bonus squares, or blank tiles (denoted as "?")

    This is just a way to get an idea of how to approach your bot, as well as the formatting.
